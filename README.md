An GUI applcation to launch gource, alternatives either dont do a rendering that you can examine or do a timestep animation

## TODO


- link the gource source as a submodule instead 
- Create gource struct that is accessed through mods
    - These mods are separate for windows and linux 

- Setup for linux / macos test
- File dialog to open the location
- FFMPEG to make the videos 
- Git-rs rust crate to temp download and host the repos, possibly logins
