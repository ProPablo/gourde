# Gourde
An GUI applcation to launch gource, alternatives either dont do a rendering that you can examine or do a timestep animation

## TODO


- link the gource source as a submodule instead 
- Generate gource bin for linux
- Create gource struct that is accessed through mods
    - These mods are separate for windows and linux 

- Setup for linux / macos test
- FFMPEG to make the videos (windows just include the binary)
- linux/ macos record videos using preinstalled ffmpeg or tell user to install ffpmeg
- Git-rs rust crate to temp download and host the repos, possibly logins
- Fix wrong unlaunchable directory (no git folder)
- fix launching program on wrong monitor

- ~~File dialog to open the location~~
